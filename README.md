# Robotic Arm
### The purpose of this project is to create a 6-DOF robotic arm that is fast, accurate and sub $1000.
This robotic arm will be designed after the [Universal Robotics UR5e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/). powered by 3 ODrive BLDC FOC controllers runniing on 48V DC power.
